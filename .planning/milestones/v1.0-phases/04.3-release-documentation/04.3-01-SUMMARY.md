# Phase 4.3 Plan 01: Release Documentation Summary

CHANGELOG and README updated from v5.0.2 to v6.0.0 with full Phase 1-4 feature documentation: HorizonPlanner LP/HiGHS, ConsumptionForecaster (InfluxDB EMA), PVForecaster (evcc Solar API), StateStore (thread-safe RLock), SSE /events endpoint, ConfigValidator, and /forecast API.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Update CHANGELOG.md with v5.1.0–v6.0.0 entries | cbe9ef3 | CHANGELOG.md, evcc-smartload/CHANGELOG.md |
| 2 | Update README.md with v6 architecture, API table, and features | 076fab3 | README.md, evcc-smartload/README.md |

## What Was Built

**Task 1 — CHANGELOG updates:**
- Added v6.0.0 entry covering: HorizonPlanner (LP/HiGHS 96-slot), ConsumptionForecaster (EMA/InfluxDB), PVForecaster (evcc Solar API), StateStore (RLock), SSE /events, ConfigValidator, /forecast endpoint, 8 new config fields, CI/CD workflow, backward compatibility
- Added v5.2.0 entry covering: forecasters as data foundation, StateStore forecast fields, 24h dashboard
- Added v5.1.0 entry covering: thread-safe StateStore, SSE push, config validation, vehicle SoC reliability, RL bootstrap fixes
- Both root and evcc-smartload/ copies are identical in new entries

**Task 2 — README updates:**
- Root README: version 5.0.2 -> 6.0.0, description updated to mention predictive LP planner, features list expanded with all v6 subsystems
- evcc-smartload/README: title updated to v6.0, features table extended with 6 new rows (24h LP-Planner, Verbrauchsprognose, PV-Prognose, StateStore, SSE Live-Updates, Config Validation), architecture section replaced with v6 ASCII diagram showing LP dispatch flow to StateStore -> SSE -> Dashboard, API table extended with /forecast and /events endpoints, config section extended with 8 new v6 fields, Wichtige Hinweise section updated with HorizonPlanner/StateStore/Forecaster guidance, /health verified and present in table

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Success Criteria Verified

- [x] CHANGELOG.md has entries for v5.1.0, v5.2.0, and v6.0.0 covering all Phase 1-4 features
- [x] README.md architecture section describes StateStore, ConsumptionForecaster, PVForecaster, HorizonPlanner, and LP dispatch flow
- [x] README.md API table lists /forecast, /events, and all other endpoints (both v5 and v6)
- [x] All version references updated from 5.0 to 6.0
- [x] Both root and evcc-smartload/ copies are consistent

## Self-Check: PASSED

Files verified:
- CHANGELOG.md: FOUND (grep -c "v6.0.0" = 1, "v5.2.0" = 1, "v5.1.0" = 1)
- evcc-smartload/CHANGELOG.md: FOUND (all three version entries = 1 each)
- README.md: FOUND (grep "6.0" returns version row)
- evcc-smartload/README.md: FOUND (HorizonPlanner = 3, /forecast = 1, /events = 3, StateStore = 4)

Commits verified:
- cbe9ef3: docs(04.3-01): add CHANGELOG entries
- 076fab3: docs(04.3-01): update README to v6.0
