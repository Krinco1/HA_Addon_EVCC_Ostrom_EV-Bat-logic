# Phase 8.1: Seasonal Feedback + Phase 5 Verification - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Wire SeasonalLearner.get_correction_factor() into the HorizonPlanner LP objective so seasonal error patterns influence dispatch cost coefficients. Additionally, formally verify Phase 5 Dynamic Buffer implementation against its original must_haves and fix any gaps found.

Gap closure for LERN-02 (seasonal feedback loop unwired) and PLAN-03 (Phase 5 missing verification).

## Implementation Decisions

### Correction conservatism
- Conservative approach — dampen correction factors toward neutral rather than applying full historical magnitude
- Better to under-correct than over-correct since dispatch has real-world consequences
- Correction code path always executes, even with zero data (returns neutral/1.0) — consistent pipeline, easier to test and debug

### Sparse data handling
- Always execute the seasonal correction code path regardless of data availability
- When no data exists, return neutral so the LP uses baseline costs unchanged

### Phase 5 verification rigor
- Walk through each must_have from Phase 5's plan, confirm the code implements it, document evidence in VERIFICATION.md
- Standard VERIFICATION.md format consistent with other phase verifications in the project
- If verification finds ANY gap (must_have not fully implemented), fix it in this phase — don't just document for later

### Claude's Discretion
- Safety cap magnitude on correction factors (pick a reasonable bound)
- Slot granularity: uniform per-season correction vs per-slot weighting
- Minimum data threshold before corrections activate
- Whether to surface correction factors in decision logs / transparency layer
- Confidence indicators for sparse data scenarios
- Phase 5 verification boundary: buffer-only vs buffer + integration points

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches. The success criteria from the roadmap are prescriptive enough to guide implementation.
