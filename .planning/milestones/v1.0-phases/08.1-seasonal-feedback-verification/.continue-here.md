<current_state>
Phase 8.1 is COMPLETE. The v1.0 milestone audit just finished with status: tech_debt (21/21 requirements satisfied, no blockers). All 12 phases executed and verified. The user needs to decide: complete milestone (accept tech debt) or plan cleanup first.
</current_state>

**This session (Phase 8.1 → Milestone Audit):**
- /gsd:discuss-phase 8.1 — captured context (correction conservatism, sparse data handling, Phase 5 verification scope)
- /gsd:plan-phase 8.1 — researched + planned + verified (1 plan, 1 wave)
- /gsd:execute-phase 8.1 — executed plan 08.1-01 (2 tasks: seasonal LP wiring + Phase 5 VERIFICATION.md)
- /gsd:audit-milestone — full v1.0 audit: 21/21 requirements, 18/18 E2E flows, 2 cosmetic integration gaps

**Phase 8.1 deliverables:**
- `_seasonal_correction_eur()` helper in main.py: calls SeasonalLearner.get_correction_factor(), 50% dampening, ±0.05 EUR/kWh cap
- Both plan() calls (primary + re-plan) receive seasonal_correction_eur parameter
- LP applies offset to normal-cost slots only (penalty/discharge unchanged)
- Phase 5 VERIFICATION.md: 15 truths, 6 artifacts, 7 key links — all PASS
- Requirements closed: LERN-02 (seasonal feedback loop), PLAN-03 (Phase 5 verification)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Milestone completion (user choice):**
- Option A: `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.0` — accept tech debt, archive, tag
- Option B: `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` — address tech debt first

**Tech debt items (8 total, all non-blocking):**
- Phase 4.2 missing VERIFICATION.md (no requirements, CI test-only)
- Dead code: rl_bootstrap_max_records config + bootstrap_from_influxdb() (Phase 8 retired it)
- Orphaned /departure-times endpoint (no frontend consumer, Telegram path works)
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability: 2 stale "Pending" rows (PLAN-03, LERN-02)
- Visual verification pending: Phases 03, 06, 07, 08 have human_verification items
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Phase 8.1 correction approach: conservative (dampen toward neutral), safety cap at Claude's discretion
- Sparse data: always execute code path, return neutral when no data
- Phase 5 verification: checklist against code, standard format, always fix gaps found
- Milestone audit status: tech_debt (not gaps_found) — all requirements satisfied, only cosmetic issues remain
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — milestone is audit-complete and ready for completion or cleanup decision.
</blockers>

<context>
SmartLoad v1.0 is feature-complete. All 21 requirements are satisfied across 12 phases with formal verification. The integration checker confirmed 18/18 E2E flows work. The only remaining items are cosmetic tech debt (dead code, orphaned endpoint, stale docs) and visual verification that requires running the actual HA add-on. The user was presented with the option to complete the milestone (accept debt) or plan cleanup first.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: Decide whether to run `/gsd:complete-milestone v1.0` (accept tech debt and archive) or `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` (create cleanup phase first). Review `.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` for full details.
