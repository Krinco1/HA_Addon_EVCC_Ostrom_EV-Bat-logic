# Phase 4.3: Release Documentation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** CHANGELOG.md and README.md accurately describe all Phases 1-4 features, APIs, and architecture
**Verified:** 2026-02-23T10:00:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | CHANGELOG.md has version entries for v5.1.0, v5.2.0, and v6.0.0 covering all Phase 1-4 features | VERIFIED | Both CHANGELOG.md files have all three version entries (grep -c returns 1 each). v6.0.0 covers HorizonPlanner, ConsumptionForecaster, PVForecaster, StateStore, SSE /events, ConfigValidator, /forecast; v5.2.0 covers data foundation; v5.1.0 covers thread-safe StateStore, config validation |
| 2 | README.md architecture section describes the v6 system: StateStore, ConsumptionForecaster, PVForecaster, HorizonPlanner LP engine, and SSE push | VERIFIED | evcc-smartload/README.md lines 121-144 contain a substantive architecture section with ASCII diagram, explanatory paragraphs naming all five components explicitly |
| 3 | README.md API table lists all endpoints including /forecast, /events, /health, and all v5+v6 endpoints | VERIFIED | evcc-smartload/README.md lines 95-119 list 20 endpoints; /forecast (v6.0), /events (v6.0), /health all present |
| 4 | README.md version references are updated from 5.0 to 6.0 | VERIFIED | Root README.md shows version 6.0.0 in add-on table; evcc-smartload/README.md title is "v6.0"; /health returns version 6.0.0 |
| 5 | Both root-level and evcc-smartload/ copies are updated consistently | VERIFIED | Root and add-on CHANGELOG.md are byte-for-byte identical for new entries (both added in same commit cbe9ef3, 99 lines each). Root README updated to 6.0.0; add-on README has full architecture and API content |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Root changelog with v5.1.0–v6.0.0 entries | VERIFIED | File exists, 158 lines total. Contains v6.0.0 (line 5), v5.2.0 (line 81), v5.1.0 (line 91) in reverse-chronological order above v5.0.2 |
| `evcc-smartload/CHANGELOG.md` | Add-on changelog with v5.1.0–v6.0.0 entries | VERIFIED | File exists, identical new entries. Contains all three version headings at correct positions |
| `README.md` | Root README with updated version and feature list | VERIFIED | File exists. Contains "6.0.0" in add-on table (line 26), description updated to mention "predictivem 24h LP-Planner", feature list includes HorizonPlanner, forecasters, StateStore, SSE, /forecast |
| `evcc-smartload/README.md` | Add-on README with architecture, API table, v6 features | VERIFIED | File exists, 169 lines. Contains "HorizonPlanner" (3 matches), "/forecast" (1 match in API table), "/events" (3 matches), "StateStore" (4 matches). Full architecture diagram at lines 123-138 |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | `evcc-smartload/CHANGELOG.md` | content parity (v6.0 entries) | VERIFIED | Both files contain identical v6.0.0, v5.2.0, v5.1.0 headings. Pattern "v6\.0" found at line 5 in both files. Committed in same commit (cbe9ef3) with 99 lines added to each |
| `README.md` | `evcc-smartload/README.md` | content parity for feature list (6.0) | VERIFIED | Root README: version 6.0.0 in table. Add-on README: title v6.0, all features documented. Pattern "6\.0" appears in both files at appropriate locations |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEPLOY-04 | 04.3-01-PLAN.md | CHANGELOG.md and README.md stale — missing Phase 3+4 docs | SATISFIED | v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md gap specified: (1) missing Phase 3 ConsumptionForecaster/PVForecaster/forecast API docs, (2) missing Phase 4 HorizonPlanner docs, (3) missing /forecast and /events API routes. All three deficiencies are now addressed in both CHANGELOG and README files |

**Requirements coverage note:** DEPLOY-04 is defined in `.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` as an audit gap identifier, not in REQUIREMENTS.md. REQUIREMENTS.md does not track DEPLOY-series identifiers — these are deployment audit gaps distinct from functional requirements (RELI-xx, PLAN-xx, etc.). The plan correctly claims DEPLOY-04 as its sole requirement. No orphaned requirements found.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — |

No TODO, FIXME, PLACEHOLDER, or stub patterns found in any of the four modified files (CHANGELOG.md, evcc-smartload/CHANGELOG.md, README.md, evcc-smartload/README.md).

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Changelog chronological order and German style consistency

**Test:** Open CHANGELOG.md and evcc-smartload/CHANGELOG.md side by side. Confirm v6.0.0 appears before v5.2.0 before v5.1.0 before v5.0.2. Read v6.0.0 entry for natural German phrasing.
**Expected:** Entries are in correct reverse-chronological order. German is fluent and matches the pre-existing v5.0.2 style.
**Why human:** Prose style, language quality, and reading order are not machine-verifiable.

#### 2. Architecture ASCII diagram renders correctly in GitHub Markdown

**Test:** Open evcc-smartload/README.md on GitHub. Check that the architecture diagram in section "v6.0 Architektur" (lines 123-138) renders with proper monospace alignment and visible arrows.
**Expected:** Diagram shows clean box-and-arrow flow from inputs through HorizonPlanner down to StateStore/SSE/Dashboard.
**Why human:** ASCII art rendering depends on font/renderer and cannot be verified by grep.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All five observable truths verified with substantive evidence. Both CHANGELOG files have complete Phase 1-4 coverage across three version entries. evcc-smartload/README.md has a full architecture section with ASCII diagram and explanatory paragraphs covering all required components (StateStore, ConsumptionForecaster, PVForecaster, HorizonPlanner, LP dispatch). The API table lists 20 endpoints including /forecast, /events, and /health with v6 version tags. Both root and add-on copies are consistent. DEPLOY-04 is closed.
