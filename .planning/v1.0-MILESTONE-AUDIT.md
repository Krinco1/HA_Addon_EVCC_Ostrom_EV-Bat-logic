# Milestone Audit: SmartLoad v1.0

**Audited:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** GAPS FOUND — Phase 8 not started; 5 requirements unsatisfied

## Executive Summary

Phases 1-7 (plus 4.1, 4.2, 4.3) are complete and verified. The system delivers a fully functional predictive energy management platform: LP-optimized 24-48h dispatch, consumption and PV forecasting, dynamic battery buffer, decision transparency with explanations and history, and full driver interaction (override, departure queries, urgency-based multi-EV priority).

Phase 8 (Residual RL and Learning) has not been started. Five v1 requirements (TRAN-03, LERN-01-04) remain unsatisfied.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied (16/21)

| Req ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| RELI-01 | Vehicle SoC correct | 2 | passed | listed | [x] |
| RELI-02 | Sequencer switches immediately | 2 | passed | listed | [x] |
| RELI-03 | Thread-safe state | 1 | passed | listed | [x] |
| RELI-04 | Config validation | 1 | passed | listed | [x] |
| RELI-05 | RL bootstrap bounded | 2 | passed | listed | [x] |
| PLAN-01 | 24-48h rolling LP plan | 4 | passed | listed | [x] |
| PLAN-02 | Dynamic LP replaces static limits | 4 | passed | listed | [x] |
| PLAN-03 | Situational min SoC | 5 | *missing* | listed | [x] |
| PLAN-04 | Consumption forecast | 3 | passed | listed | [x] |
| PLAN-05 | PV forecast | 3 | passed | listed | [x] |
| TRAN-01 | Decision explanations | 6 | passed | listed | [x] |
| TRAN-02 | Plan timeline dashboard | 6 | passed | listed | [x] |
| TRAN-04 | Planned vs actual | 6 | passed | listed | [x] |
| DRIV-01 | Manual override | 7 | passed | listed | [x] |
| DRIV-02 | Departure time query | 7 | passed | listed | [x] |
| DRIV-03 | Urgency priority | 7 | passed | listed | [x] |

Note: PLAN-03 is **partial** — implementation exists but Phase 5 lacks VERIFICATION.md.

### Unsatisfied (5/21) — All Phase 8

| Req ID | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| TRAN-03 | RL vs Planner dashboard comparison |
| LERN-01 | RL delta corrections |
| LERN-02 | Seasonal pattern learner |
| LERN-03 | Adaptive reaction timing |
| LERN-04 | Forecast confidence calibration |

## Phase Status

| Phase | Plans | Verification | Status |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1. State Infrastructure | 2/2 | passed (7/7) | ✓ |
| 2. Vehicle Reliability | 2/2 | passed (7/7) | ✓ |
| 3. Data Foundation | 3/3 | passed (14/14) | ✓ |
| 4. Predictive Planner | 3/3 | passed (5/5) | ✓ |
| 4.1 Deploy Config | 1/1 | passed (4/4) | ✓ |
| 4.2 CI/CD Pipeline | 1/1 | *missing* | ⚠ |
| 4.3 Release Docs | 1/1 | passed (5/5) | ✓ |
| 5. Dynamic Buffer | 2/2 | *missing* | ⚠ |
| 6. Decision Transparency | 3/3 | passed (12/12) | ✓ |
| 7. Driver Interaction | 3/3 | passed (13/13) | ✓ |
| 8. Residual RL | 0/5 | — | ✗ Not started |

## Cross-Phase Integration

28/31 cross-phase connections verified. All critical data flows wired:
- StateStore → all consumers (web, SSE, snapshotter)
- Forecasters → HorizonPlanner → LP dispatch → controller
- OverrideManager → main loop bypass → evcc "now" mode
- DepartureTimeStore → HorizonPlanner + ChargeSequencer urgency
- PlanSnapshotter → InfluxDB → /history → Historie tab

5/6 E2E flows complete. Missing: RL delta corrections → dashboard comparison (Phase 8).

## Tech Debt

- `_compute_price_zones()` flat approximation in /forecast (cosmetic — LP unaffected)
- `_api_docs()` HTML missing Phase 5/6/7 endpoints
- CI is test-only (no automated publishing)
- Phase 05 missing VERIFICATION.md

## Recommendation

Phase 8 has 5 unsatisfied v1 requirements. Options:

**A. Execute Phase 8** — implement RL residual learning, seasonal learner, forecast calibration, and dashboard comparison

**B. Defer Phase 8 to v2** — move TRAN-03 and LERN-01-04 to v2 requirements, completing v1 with the 16 satisfied requirements. Phases 1-7 deliver a complete, production-ready system without the learning layer.
